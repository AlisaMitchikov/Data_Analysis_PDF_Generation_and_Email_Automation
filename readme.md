2. load_data_from_sources_to_dfs.py: Contains logic to load data from various sources into DataFrames.
3. analysis_of_dfs_to_pdf.py: Analyzes the data from the DataFrames and generates a PDF report.
4. send_pdf_via_email.py: Sends the generated PDF report via email using configured credentials.
5. app_config.py: Loads email configuration from a .env file and stores it as environment variables.
6. requirements.txt: Contains all the Python dependencies for the project.


## Customization
- Data Loading: Modify load_data_from_sources_to_dfs.py to customize the data source (e.g., databases, CSV files, APIs).
- Analysis: Customize analysis_of_dfs_to_pdf.py to change the analysis or data visualizations.
